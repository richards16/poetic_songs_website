            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <h4 id="summary">
                "Hallelujah" explores themes of love, spirituality, and human frailty through a series of biblical references and contemporary reflections. The song's verses often present contradictory emotions and images, blending the sacred with the profane, the romantic with the spiritual.
