            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <h4 id="summary">
                The poem "In the Realm of Imagination" paints a vivid picture of imagination as a vast, wondrous place that comes alive in moments of quiet reflection. It likens imagination to a magical night sky filled with stars, mountains of thoughts, and oceans of dreams. In this fantastical world, wishes, hopes, and creativity flourish, with mythical elements like singing trees and wizards. The poem emphasizes that imagination is a realm where the impossible becomes possible, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy dissolve, and where every story, creature, and sound can be found. Ultimately, it invites the reader to embrace their imaginative world, a place of endless possibilities and boundless creativity.

            <h4>
                Lennon was known for his wit, rebellious nature, and outspoken views on politics and social issues. He wrote and co-wrote many of The Beatles' greatest hits, including songs like "Imagine," "Strawberry Fields Forever," "Help!," and "All You Need Is Love." After The Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon pursued a solo career, continuing to create music that addressed personal and political themes.
                One of Lennon's most famous solo works is the song "Imagine," released in 1971. The song envisions a world of peace without borders, religions, or possessions, reflecting Lennon's idealism and his hope for global harmony.
    
    Tragically, John Lennon was assassinated in 1980 outside his New York City apartment building by Mark David Chapman. Despite his untimely death, Lennon's music and messages continue to resonate with audiences around the world, cementing his legacy as a cultural and musical icon.
